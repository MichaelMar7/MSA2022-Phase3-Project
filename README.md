# MSA2022-Phase3-Project

This is my project for MSA 2022 Phase 3. I will be doing the same modules as I did in Phase 2, which were the Front-End Module and Data Science Module.

## Front-End Module

I have continued using my Front-ENd apo from Phase 2 to make it easier.

One change I made that is not related to the advanced features is a (still not perfect) way to visibily inciate the search mode of the api.

Now for my advanced features that I've implemented:
- UI Scalability with window size
- Mobile first development (using media query breakpoints, etc)

## Data Science Module
